# Project State

**Status:** Defining requirements
**Current phase:** Not started
**Last updated:** 2026-06-10
**Next action:** Define requirements and roadmap for v3.0

---

## Phase Status

*(phases defined after roadmapping)*

---

## Project Reference

See: `.planning/PROJECT.md`

**Core value:** An HR advisor can describe work in plain language and receive a legally defensible, fully traceable job description — grounded in NOC, collective agreement, and TBS classification policy — in minutes instead of hours.

**Architecture non-negotiables (do not change without a phase transition):**

- ProvenanceTag on every exported content element — set at write time, rendered at export
- Every content element in the exported DOCX/PDF must trace to an authoritative source citation
- Evidence-based classification (NOC pipeline + OG ranker + JES scoring) — deterministic in the main flow
- Socratic constraint: manager never selects OG directly; OG is derived from accumulated answer signals

---

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions Carried from v2.0

| Decision | Rationale |
|----------|-----------|
| React 18 SPA + FastAPI JSON API | Client-side state needed for conversational UX; established in v2.0 |
| Deterministic OG classification (no LLM in main flow) | Correct, auditable, offline; LLM used only for NOC justification |
| Hardcoded JES tables over LLM scoring | Published standards with fixed scales; faster and auditable |
| Phase numbering continues (v3.0 starts at Phase 21) | Single linear history; v1.0 phases 1–9, v2.0 phases 10–20 archived |
| docxtpl for DOCX export | Python-native, ARM64 compatible, Jinja2 template model |
